# 2018-Group2
Abstractâ€” The inspiration for this project came from the armadillo. This creature can curl itself into a ball, protecting its vulnerable parts with plates made of bone acting as armour. While the armadillo moves using its legs, this robot always remains in a spherical shape, and moves using wheels inside the sphere. It is theorised a robot of this design could be used in demining. The sphere rolls over a mine, detonates it, then survives the impact and can move on to detonate further mines. The robot makes use of soft materials rather than hard plates in order to survive impacts. The open source GitHub repository can be located here: https://github.com/MrCFreestone/ROCO504-GROUP2
